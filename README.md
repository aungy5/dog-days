  ## Description
  A blog-style site that can double as a site for adoptions. We have a blog section where users can post about their dogs and comment on posts from other users. Then we have a Dogs section where users can view all the dogs that they could adopt from our site, as well as save the dogs to their profile. Lastly, we have a breed search section where users can browse different breeds of dogs to see which one might be the best fit for them.
